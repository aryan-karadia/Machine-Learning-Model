# Kernel Seed Machine Learning Model

This group project taught me how to create and train a machine learning model. This ML model focuses on classifying different types of wheat seed kernels, given a dataset of 210 instances, 7 attributes, and seperated into 3 classes. With the help of my group members, we conducted graphical analysis to understand the relationship between different atrributes and the seed class they belong to. This allowed us to visualize how the machine learning model can classify new instances if it was given enough information about the seed. The machine learning model created performed with an accuracy rating of 91.67% in the training set of data, and 90.57% in the test data, using a KNN classifier of 15 using the StandardScaler() method for attribute preprocessing. This KNN classifier was established by testing a magnitude of classifiers using multiple attribute preprocessing methods. The accuracy of the data was measured using a test set of data points, and a  normalized confusion matrix to visually show the results.
