# Kernel Seed Machine Learning Model

This project focused on expanding on a new dataset relating to wheat with 210 instances, 7 attributes, and 3 classes. The team conducted graphical data analysis to understand the relationship between different attributes and the wheat varietals. Through their analysis, they found that width of kernel is strongly correlated with the type of varietal. Using this insight, they developed a machine learning model to classify new instances of wheat varietals with an accuracy rate of 91.67% in the training set, and 90.57% in the test set using K=15 and StandardScaler() method for attribute preprocessing. Overall, the project aimed to understand the relationship between different attributes of wheat and the varietals they belong to, with the ultimate goal of developing a model to classify new instances of wheat varietals with high accuracy.
